# Python Basics

In this project there are a bunch of python basic programming language projects for you to play around. From the traditional rock, paper, scissors, to the more complex Connect 4, or even a crypto wallet value predictor. These are simple, yet entertaining to mess around on your terminal.

## Steps

```sh
cd game_directory
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## Licence or Recognition

No need to licence or give any recognition of this repository, just made it to practice and have some fun on the meantime while practicing python.
